TODO file for FloPoCo wrapper
https://xkcd.com/844/
* List of operators to port to the new pipeline framework
	Remove an operator from the list below when it is done.
THIS INCLUDES WRITING ITS AUTOTEST

	InputIEEE
	FPAssign
	FPge_expr
	FPgt_expr
	FPle_expr
	FPlt_expr
	
	The previous operators still need to:
	1/ add the delays
	2/ revise functionality within new FloPoCo version
